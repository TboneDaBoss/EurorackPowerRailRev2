# EurorackPowerRailRev2

This power board is a simple but feature-full design to power your eurorack modules. The parts being used are easy to obtain and the board can be populated in no time.

Features:
- 8pcs of power connectors, 10 pin or 16 pin
- 6 holes for mounting
- [Optional] On-board 5V line converter
- [Optional] The boards can be Daisy-chained using jumpers in the corners
- [Optional] Screw terminal connectors on every corner


Please note that the LED in the midle has a reverse orientation compared to the others!

Use ~100nF for the ceramic and ~47uF for the electrolitic caps. The caps for the converter are 1nF tantalum. Use caps with at least 25V tolerance.

The resistors for the LEDs are up to your taste but a value between 1k and 10k should work fine.

I recommend using 1N4004 for the diodes.
